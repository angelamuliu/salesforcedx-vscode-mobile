# salesforce-offline-vscode

With the [Offline App Developer Starter Kit](https://github.com/salesforce/offline-app-developer-starter-kit) serving as the primary entry point for customers to get started using the Offline App in Salesforce App Plus, we want to give them as straightforward of an onboarding process as possible.

Salesforce Offline VSCode is a VSCode extension that asks the user a series of questions targeted at configuring their Org and environment for using the Offline App, then takes their input and automates those configuration items, taking much of the manual labor/configuration off the plate of the user.
